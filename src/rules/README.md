# Rules to be accepted as a CodeTap student

You came to CodeTap for a specific reason. In a few words you want to become a star, whatever that means to you, as quickly as possible. You want to make your dreams come true and nothing of this will come without hard work from your side. Don’t worry, the hard work has been already done by me, all you have to do is invest all the available time you can in yourself and up your skills in coding, interviews, influence, community, collaboration and more.
And in order to do that you want to start to:
Be efficient about it
Always write code, if you read / watch only, it doesn’t count
Learn while you practice
Communicate and be nice
Always write code
  If you read a book or a tutorial and it has examples, always write those examples. If it doesn’t have examples for every idea that’s new to you, use Google or any other search engine to find examples and write them, see them working and done in front of you by your hand.
  If you watch a video tutorial, always write and do what the teacher does. Half of the questions you might have before you do it usually go away or self explain. If you don’t retain or understand everything, train again by watching one or more times the movie. If there is something unclear Google the s**t out of it, do your best to find the answer yourself, as this is one of the main skills you want to train as a web developer. Train yourself to search for solution online or offline, how to quickly filter the most appealing solutions, how to use partial solutions and unify more of them to get a full one, how to adapt from one different piece of code to meet your requirement and satisfy your needs. This is something I keep doing after 21 years, and every developer does, it’s nothing wrong, it’s not bad to do it, it’s part of a developer’s day to day life.
Only when you’ve run out of ideas, do a quick description iterating all your research, all the ways you’ve tried and failed and contact the person in the video or your mentor.
Learn while you practice
  Watching too many courses without setting a real world goal and doing progress about it is usually the thinkers trap. In most cases it’s a waste of time. The basic idea is to define a project and it’s requirements, even if you don’t know how to do it. Break down requirements into smaller chunks until you can’t break them down anymore. Identify which ones you know how to do and start with them. The tasks that you don’t know how to do are going to tell you which articles, courses or other resources you want to tap into them and start learning more. As soon as a course gives you the answer to one of your tasks, stop learning and solve that task. Repeat this process until all tasks are done.
Communicate and be nice
There is a way where you start watching all the free lessons on CodeTap, which doesn’t require any One to One or Mentor interaction at all. You’re better off to leave comments anyway so don’t forget that. Simply visit http://codetap.io/youtube or http://codetap.io/start and start watching the playlists in reverse order, the oldest first. Most CodeTap students have done these ones:


Before we start coding
Everyone can code
Learn to code like a PRO for beginners
Your resume online for FREE with HTML5 and CSS3
Quick Blog

  The second way, follow-up to the first one is to get a mentor. I, Marian Zburlea, the founder of CodeTap, challenge you firstly to show that you’re worthy of my help. In order to be able to receive my mentoring you MUST:
JOIN the CodeTap group at https://facebook.com/groups/codetap
Support CodeTap on Patreon with at least $1 per month. https://www.patreon.com/codetap/memberships I don’t even want to hear about it, $1 is peanuts compared to what you’re getting. I want to see this minimum effort from you. The minimum contribution after you get a job is $25, otherwise we shake hands and wonder different paths.
Subscribe to CodeTap on YouTube at http://codetap.io/youtube and make sure you clicked on the notification bell as well
Like CodeTap page and make sure to update the view notifications setting https://www.facebook.com/codetap/
DO all three beginner PLAYLISTS on CodeTap on YouTube (Before we start coding, Everyone can code, Learn to code like a PRO for beginners)
 For each movie that you watch, you MUST drop at least one comment.   This is how you develop your skills as a team player and good communicator, which companies strive for. The comment should not be like “Marian, you’re awesome, let me kiss your ass some more” although feel free to thank me if you like. If you thank me, I’ll really appreciate however you MUST drop at least one more comment that is on the subject of the movie. This can contain:
What did you learned new
If you’re excited about a particular thing, where would you implement it? It can be fictive, imaginary.
If you had a problem, describe the problem with as much detail as you can and what did you tried to fix it. Your fails might be just one step away from solving it and without proper communication both of us lose the opportunity to share and gain knowledge.
If your question requires screenshots than drop a comment saying that you’ve created a post on https://facebook.com/groups/codetap 
I want you to build a resume for each project / playlist. With each comment that you write, you can copy / paste it into your resume to help you out a bit in writing it. Once the resume is done we’ll have a sit down and chat about it. I’ll help you out to strengthen what you’ve already understood and point out other ones that you’ve missed. This will help you express yourself better during phone calls, interviews and after you get hired in team chats.
PS. No bad behaviour or bad words among the team mates. It’s accepted among friends as, you know, man talk. But not the real bad behaviour. Whoever did it before got kicked out.
